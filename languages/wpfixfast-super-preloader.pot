msgid "This plugin helps warm up Cloudflare edge caches by preloading your public URLs using a Worker script and optional rotating proxies. It helps reduce time-to-first-byte (TTFB) and improve real user performance metrics by ensuring content is already cached near your visitors."
msgstr ""

#: includes/partials/setup-guide.php:18
msgid "Normally, Cloudflare only populates its edge cache in a specific location when a visitor from that region requests the page. This means content may be slow for first-time visitors in other geographic regions. By sending preload requests from various IP locations, the plugin helps increase Cloudflare cache hit rates across multiple edges."

#. translators: %s is a clickable link to the Super Page Cache plugin.
#: includes/partials/setup-guide.php:29
msgid "It works best when used together with a caching plugin like %s, since Cloudflare does not cache HTML responses by default—only static assets like images, CSS, and JS. This can lead to better scores in Core Web Vitals—especially the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)—which is a key factor in SEO and user experience."
